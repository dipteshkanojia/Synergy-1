Synergy
=======

Share one mouse and keyboard between multiple computers.

Synergy is free and open source (free as in free speech),
meaning you are free to run it and redistribute it with
or without changes.

Just use "hm conf" and "hm build" to compile (./hm.sh on
Linux and Mac).

Modified hm.sh to invoke python2 rather than python3(default).
